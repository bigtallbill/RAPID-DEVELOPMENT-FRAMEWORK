Created by the @marketmesuite team. An open source project. Please feel free to fork this project and improve it.

MarketMeSuite is built on the first version of the RDF, one which has evolved over time. This is a new RDF being developed with everything we've learned. With the orignal RDF we were able to get a prototype of MarketMeSuite in just a few days whilst other functionality followed.

NOTE: This framework is not ready to use yet. It's still being set up. Only download if you are looking to contribute to the project.

@TODO
=====
- Login Module
- Base classes for frequently used stuff (nothing too heavy).
- Icon set (awesome icon set)
- Stylesheet / stylesheet page. Probably bootstrap.

RAPID DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK
===========================

A super lightweight framework, to get projects going, but not heavy enough that you need to learn how it works.
Just 'Download & Go!'.


PROJECT AIMS
============

- Not a heavy framework for php, like cake, codeigniter etc. Anyone should be able to pick this up without reading doucmentation.
- Provide a sensible structure in which to build new applications
- Provide a set of resources, icons, style sheets, to get started fast.
- Adhere to MVC (model view controller) principles as well as possible.
- Provide a secure, default login page in which to get started
- Modulize the app from the start allowing furhter integrations later.
- No database bias, let the user decide what database they want to use.
- Include a few lightweight, easy to use classes, but nothing that bogs you down trying to learn a new framework.
