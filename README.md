- Base classes for frequently used stuff (nothing too heavy).
- Icon set (awesome icon set)
- Stylesheet / stylesheet page. Probably bootstrap.

RAPID DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK
===========================

A super lightweight framework, to get projects going, but not heavy enough that you need to learn how it works.
Just 'Download & Go!'.


Project AIMS
============

- Provide a sensible structure in which to build new applications
- Provide a set of resources, icons, style sheets, to get started fast.
- Adhere to MVC (model view controller) principles as well as possible.
- Provide a secure, default login page in which to get started
- Modulize the app from the start allowing furhter integrations later.
- No database bias, let the user decide what database they want to use.
- Include a few lightweight, easy to use classes, but nothing that bogs you down trying to learn a new framework.
